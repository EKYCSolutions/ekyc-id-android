The EkycID Android SDK lets you build a factastic OCR and Face Recognition experienced in your Android app.

With one quick scan, your users will be able to extract information from thier identity cards, passports, driver licenses, license plate, vehicle registration, covid-19 vaccinate card, and any other document by government-issued.


EkycID is:
* Easy to integrate into existing ecosystems and solutions through the use of SDKs that supported both native and hybrid applications.
* Better for user experience being that the document detections and liveness checks are done directly offline on the device.
* Great for cutting down operations cost and increasing efficiency by decreasing reliance on human labor and time needed for manual data entry. 


EkycID can:
* Extract information from identity documents through document recognition & OCR.
* Verify whether an individual is real or fake through liveness detection, and face recognition. 
* Verify the authenticity of the identity documents by combining the power of document detection, OCR, liveness detection, and face recognition.
